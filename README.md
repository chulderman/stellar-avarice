# Development branches
Open up a new branch if you are going to work on any issues. If a branch exists for an issue, communicate with that collaborator to establish what needs to be done to start on that or a new branch. 

## Requests branch
This branch has been opened up to transition the project over to the python-requests library instead of the current urllib2 implementation. Please go to this branch or create a new one from it to help on issue #4
